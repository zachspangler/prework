							<p><strong>Profession:</strong> Verizon Call Center Customer Support</p>
							<p><strong>Technology:</strong> Malcolm is an avid user of technology. He is always purchasing the latest
								model of anything Apple releases. He regularly claims "If my house were burning down and
								I could only grab three things including my family. I would grab my MabBook Pro, his Bongo Drum
								and HTC Vive. </p>

								brothers.</p>
